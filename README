TARGETED PLATFORMS

UNIX-like operating systems and/or platforms where the Python Curses library is supported.


RUNNING:

$ python picasso.py

or

$ ./picasso


The program will prompt the user for command input, supported commands are:

C w h: Draws a canvas with width w and height h

L x1 y1 x2 y2: Draws line from point (x1, y1) to point (x2, y2)
               (Make sure line is either vertical or horizontal)

R x1 y1 x2 y2: Draws a rectangle with (x1, y1) as upper left corner, and
               (x2, y2) as lower right corner

B x y color: Fill area containing point (x, y) with selected color.
             color must be alphanumeric.


RUNNING UNIT TESTS:

The test suite uses the Python library mock, before running the tests install it by running:

$ pip install mock

After that, the tests can be run:

$ python tests.py


MANUAL TESTS:

$ python picasso.py tests

These tests run predetermined commands, and the output should be as follows:

----------------------
|oooooooooooooooxxxxx|
|xxxxxxooooooooox   x|
|     xoooooooooxxxxx|
|     xoooooooooooooo|
----------------------

This test can be run to quickly determine if the program is working to some extent.
